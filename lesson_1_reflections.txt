How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Being able to see only the lines that have changed takes much less time than reading 
	the entire document.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    See how the code of the file may have progressed to perform the same function
	more efficiently or what bits of code may have caused unintended problems in 
	earlier versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Auto - can have too many versions to be useful plus you have no reference of the change,
	Manual - user may forget to save or comment on the save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Changes must be tracked across files that work together to make up one solution

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will display all commits, right click at the top left corner to copy 
	and then paste into a git diff command

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always revert back to an older version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Learning Javascript
