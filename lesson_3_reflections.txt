When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When it is desirable to work from multiple locations and/or with multiple people.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	To prevent code that is not ready from being public.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
		forks are copies of repositories that are stored on github and reference the original.
		clones are copies of repositories that are stored either on github or on a local machine and do not reference the original.
		branches are separate versions of the same project stored inside that project.
