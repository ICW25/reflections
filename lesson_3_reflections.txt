When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When it is desirable to work from multiple locations and/or with multiple people.
  
  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	to prevent code that is not ready from being public.
